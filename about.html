      Basketball was created in 1891 by a Canadian gym teacher named James
      Naismith. He wanted to keep his students active during the winter, so he
      came up with a game that could be played indoors. He nailed a peach basket
      to the gym balcony and used a soccer ball to play. The game became popular
      and spread to colleges and universities in the United States. Today,
      basketball is played all over the world and has become a big professional
      sport.

      To score in basketball, you have to throw the ball through the other
      team's basket. If you're close to the basket, you get two points for a
      basket. If you're farther away and make the basket, you get three points.
      Sometimes, you can also earn a point by making a free throw after a foul.
      The team with the most points wins the game. If the game is tied, they
      play more until someone wins.

      season goes from October to April, with playoffs in April to June. The NBA
      has the best players from around the world, and it's really popular, with
      lots of fans all over.

      In basketball, a foul happens when a player breaks the rules by doing
      something like pushing or tripping an opponent. If a player fouls too many
      times, they may not be allowed to play anymore. Fouls can also give the
      other team a chance to score points by taking a free throw shot. The type
      of foul and its consequences can vary, from just a warning to being kicked
      out of the game.
